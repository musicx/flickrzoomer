this is a forge for the Flickr Zoomer for RSS reader http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/48738 

because google reader is going to retire, flickr image zoomer is needed for other rss readers.

I simply remove the auto scroll part so that this script can work on any rss reader you want.

The modification also includes that I set the default size of the flickr image to be "original" but not 500px, 640px or 800px. You can shift between these sizes with Shift+S and a page refresh after.

Will have more updates later...
